          <h1 class="text-center">The Big Day</h1>
          <p>We are booked in to the Caernarfon registry office for the ceremony to start at 12pm (guest arrival time is still to be confrimed) and can't wait to see everyone there.
            <br>
            The ceremony will last around 30-45 minutes and we have a photographer that will take some photos during the ceremony. <br><br>
            After the ceremony, we will get a few photos with friends and family, both at the registry office and possible at or around Caernarfon Castle.<br><br>
            As I'm sure you will agree, Wales has some of the most beautiful scenary and it would be a shame to not take advantage of this. <br><br>
            As a result, this is where we will leave you to your own devices where you can go off get some lunch and enjoy the day until the evening.<br>
            If you are looking for ideas on what you can do for the day, Red Dragon has you covered: <a href="https://www.reddragonholidays.co.uk/things-to-do/" title="">Here!</a><br><br>
            We will head off into the mountains with the photographer and have various photos planned (you are welcome to join us on this excursion if you want but there is no pressure).
            <br><br> Once we have our photography trip planned, we will update this page or the facebook page so you can decide if you would like to come and find us at any point.
            <br><br> Once we finish with our photographer, we will then make our way to <strong>Glaslyn Ices and Pizzeria</strong> for a lovely meal and one or two bevvies.
            <br><br>As a thank you for coming all this way to witness our special day, we will pick up the food bill*.<br><br><br>
            *We are on a slight budget so your first drink will be included but if you want any extras then you just need to pick these up. If you want to come back to Red Dragon after the meal then we will have some drinks available to continue the celebrations!

            <p>We are heading to Snowdonia the weekend before the wedding (10th September).</p>
            <br>As we are going to be in the area for an extended amount of time, we have booked a cottage at Red Dragon Holidays. <br>
            We would love for everyone to stay at Red Dragon with us and, as part of our wedding party you can receive a 10% booking discount (more information on this below).<br>
            The benefit of staying with us at Red Dragon is that after the meal, we can carry on celebrating through the night and week with cheaper food and drink from your Supermarket of choice. <br>
            If you are interested in this, please check their website at the available cottages/Pods.
            <br><br> The website is: <a href="https://www.reddragonholidays.co.uk/" title="">https://www.reddragonholidays.co.uk/</a>
            <br><br> We appreciate that self contained cottages may not be everyones cup of tea so there is no pressure if you don't wish to hire a cottage.
            <br> If you would rather look for a B&B or hotel, you can find plenty of accomodation in the local village (Beddgelert), which is around a 5 minute drive from Red Dragon Holidays.<br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, there is plenty of accomodation in Llanberis, Porthmadog and Caernarfon, however, we have not stayed in these places so are unable to recommend anything specific.<br>
            We have stayed at 'The Prince Llewelyn' in Beddgelert, it is a nice pub but has changed hands a lot over the years so not too sure how it is now.<br>
            There are also some lovely campsites, if that's your thing. If so, Llyn Gwynant campsite is beyond amazing.
          </p>
