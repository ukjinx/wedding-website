          <h1 class="text-center">The Big Day</h1>
          <p>We are booked in to the Caernarfon registry office at 11am and can't wait to see everyone there.
            <br>
            The ceremony will last around 30 minutes and we have a photographer that will take some photos during the ceremony. <br>
            <br>After the ceremony, we will get a few photos with our friends and family, both at the registry office and at Caernarfon Castle.<br>
            As I'm sure you will agree, Wales has some of the most beautiful landscapes and it would be a shame to not take advantage of this. <br><br>
            As a result, this is where we will leave you to go off and do your own thing and grab some food for a few hours.<br>
            We will head off into the mountains with our photographer and have various photos planned (you are welcome to join us on this excursion).
            <br> Once we have our photography trip planned, we will update this page so you can decide if you would like to come and find us.<br>
            <br> Once we finish with our photographer, we will then make our way to "insert name of pub here" for a lovely meal and one or two bevvies.<br>
            <br>As a thank you for coming all this way to witness our special day, we will pick up the food bill.<br>
            Unfortunately, as we are on a budget, we just ask for you to get your own drinks.

            <p>We are planning on heading to Snowdonia the weekend before the wedding (approximately 10th September).</p>
            <br>As we will be in the area for an extended amount of time, we will be planning on booking a cottage at Red Dragon Holidays. <br>
            We would love for everyone to stay at Red Dragon with us and, if we book at the same time then we can get a 10% group booking discount. <br>
            The benefit of this is that we can carry on celebrating through the night and week with cheap food and drink from Tesco. <br>
            If you are interested in this, please check their website at the available cottages/Pods and let us know ASAP as spaces are filling up quickly. Myself and Donna will be booking the Sygun cottage.
            <br><br> The website is: <a href="https://www.reddragonholidays.co.uk/" title="">https://www.reddragonholidays.co.uk/</a>
            <br><br> We appreciate that self contained cottages may not be everyones cup of tea so there is no pressure if you don't wish to hire a cottage.
            <br> If you would rather look for a B&B, you can find plenty of accomodation in the local village of Beddgelert, which is near Red Dragon Holidays. <br>
            Alternatively, you can also find accomodation in Llanberis, Porthmadog or Caernarfon.<br>
            We are unable to provide recommendations at these places as we generally stay at Red Dragon.
